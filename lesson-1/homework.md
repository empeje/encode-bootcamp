# Problem

Discuss in your teams what a decentralized version of a game like monopoly would be like, if there was no software on a central server.

Consider
* What are the essential pieces of functionality?
* How could people cheat?
* How could you prevent them from cheating?

This is just a general discussion, there's no need to write any code or o any detailed design.
