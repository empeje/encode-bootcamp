# My Answer

1. Imagine you are designing a blockchain system
   1. What behaviour / aspects of the system do you want to encourage?
      1. Securing the network
      2. Makes it very hard to do 51% attack
      3. Make it the best interest of user to secure the system
      4. Economically rewards people who secure the network
      5. Encourage usage of the network
      6. Easy onboarding to the platform
   2. What behaviour / aspects of the system do you want to discourage?
      1. Rich getting richer
      2. Unfair advantage for user with high capacity
      3. Economy of scale for miners and validators
   3. How have these behaviours been incentivised in Bitcoin?
      1. Bitcoin encourage user to mine by having a mining rewards
      2. Bitcoin makes it hard for miner to hack because the cost of 51% attack getting hire as the chain getting bigger adoption.
2. Are 51% attacks possible in Proof of Stake?
   1. It is possible but unlikely if the PoS system discourage this behaviour through slashing mechanism. Additionally, a chain that already big like Ethereum can prevent this attack because the cost of 51% might outweight the benefit.
